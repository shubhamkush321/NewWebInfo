      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">SEO Consultations</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The initial stage in Search Engine Optimization is to assess a website and define a future plan.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>#1 Examine the Existing Website</strong><br />
        Every website has a domain name, which has a good or negative past. If your domain is newly new, it will have no previous history. The age of your domain, its trust and authority, the size of your website, and its historical content all have a role in how you presently rank in search and how tough it will be to increase your SEO rating in the future.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>#2 Examine Your Competitors</strong><br />
        In search engine optimization, ranking does not happen in a vacuum. Ranking takes place in a competitive atmosphere, where you’re competing with other websites in your industry.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>#3 Take a Look at the Branding That Goes Along With It (Internet Footprint)</strong><br />
        On the internet, how well-known is your company’s branding (name, contact information)? Is your company’s name or website listed in every online directory? Is your business or website on every social media platform? Do other supporting websites, such as associations, trade groups, and partner websites, mention and link to your brand or website?
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">SEO Benchmarking</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To know where you are and where you have been, you must first understand where you are…
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Simply said, a benchmark is a starting point. We need to develop some benchmarks for where a website is right now. This encompasses both on-site and off-site optimization. Traffic, search engine ranking, site structure, and content are all factors.
